# google-account-chooser

If you use Google Account Authentication in applications on a day to day basis this chrome extension is for you.

After selecting to log in to a 3rd party site using a Google Account this extension will remember which account you used so next time you log in you just have to select login and this extension will select the account automatically.

This extension needs to access the Account Selection page and stores the selected account/email per domain.  If you use Google Account sync it will synchronise this between browsers.

It does not store passwords or any other sensitive authentication data and does not store data from the pages you visit.

## Questions and Answers
Q: What if I picked the wrong account?

A: Just select the toolbar icon and select "Remove as default".  Now log in again
and select the right account.

Q: What if I switch between multiple accounts for a domain?

A: You have two options.  Use different browser sessions (Switch Person) or disable
the extension for this domain.  Select toolbar icon and select "Disable for Domain".

Q: Why does Google let me select the account each time even though I only have one?

A: This is so that you have the option of logging into account number two (even if
you will never need that Google can't know that).

Q: Why did you create this extension?

A: I typically have to select the right Google Account 10-20 times per day and I
just thought there was a better way to do that!
