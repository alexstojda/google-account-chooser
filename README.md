# google-account-chooser

If you use Google Authentication in applications on a day to day basis this
chrome extension is for you. It will remember for each domain what Google Account
you typically use for each domain.

Simply install the extension and wait until it learns your preferences.

## Questions and Answers
Q: What if I picked the wrong account?

A: Just select the toolbar icon and select "Remove as default".  Now log in again
and select the right account.

Q: What if I switch between multiple accounts for a domain?

A: You have two options.  Use different browser sessions (Switch Person) or disable
the extension for this domain.  Select toolbar icon and select "Disable for Domain".

Q: Why does Google let me select the account each time even though I only have one?

A: This is so that you have the option of logging into account number two (even if
you will never need that Google can't know that).

Q: Why did you create this extension?

A: I typically have to select the right Google Account 10-20 times per day and I
just thought there was a better way to do that!
